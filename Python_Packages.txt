For your reference, we are providing versions of libraries that were tested 
in Python 3.10 environment. Since you may already have some of these libraries
installed, you don't need to install specific versions unless you get errors. 

Your instructor will advise you if the error is related to the version.

If you would like to install all libraries at the same time, then you can use this commend (we included requirements.txt in the same folder as this file). We recommend using this approach if you're a Python developer and know how to troubleshoot installation errors. 

pip install -r requirements.txt
